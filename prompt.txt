I want to create an app Environmental Incident Reporting Platform
Description:
Develop an API for citizens to report environmental incidents (pollution, illegal dumping, etc.) with:

Geotagged incident reports.

Search for incidents by proximity, type, or textual similarity (using pgvector).

Include endpoints for both structured (SQLAlchemy models) and semi-structured (vector, text embedding) data.

PostGIS: Geofencing or “incidents within area.”

pgvector: Similarity of incident descriptions or auto-tagging. 

I want to use pythoon and FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL with PostGIS/pgvector and Pydantic. 

Act as planner
