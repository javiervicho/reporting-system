# Environmental Incident Reporting Platform

## Background and Motivation
The Environmental Incident Reporting Platform aims to empower citizens to report environmental incidents such as pollution, illegal dumping, and other environmental violations. By leveraging geospatial data and modern vector search capabilities, this platform will enable efficient reporting, searching, and analysis of environmental incidents. The platform will utilize PostgreSQL extensions like PostGIS for geospatial operations and pgvector for semantic similarity searches, creating a comprehensive system for environmental monitoring and response.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

2. **Vector Embeddings for Text Similarity**:
   - Generating quality text embeddings for incident descriptions
   - Implementing efficient vector similarity searches with pgvector
   - Auto-tagging incidents based on description content

3. **Mixed Data Structure**:
   - Managing both structured data (standard fields) and semi-structured data (vector embeddings)
   - Creating a cohesive API that integrates both data types
   - Optimizing database queries across different data models

4. **Database Design**:
   - Setting up PostgreSQL with PostGIS and pgvector extensions
   - Designing schemas that accommodate geospatial queries and vector searches
   - Ensuring efficient indexing for all query patterns

5. **API Design and Data Validation**:

## Alembic Migration Implementation Plan

### Background and Motivation
Database schema changes are inevitable as the application evolves. Implementing Alembic will provide a structured way to manage database migrations, track schema changes, and maintain version control for the database schema. This will make it easier to deploy updates and maintain database consistency across different environments.

### Key Challenges and Analysis

   - Ensuring Alembic properly handles PostGIS geometry types
   - Configuring Alembic to work with pgvector extension
   - Properly identifying schema changes for spatial and vector data

2. **Migration Script Generation**:
   - Implementing automatic migration script generation
   - Handling custom SQL commands for PostGIS and pgvector operations

3. **Database Versioning**:
   - Establishing a baseline migration for the existing schema
   - Creating a version control workflow for future changes

### High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Alembic Setup**
   - Install Alembic
   - Initialize Alembic in the project
   - Configure Alembic to work with existing SQLAlchemy models
   - Success Criteria: Alembic initialized with proper configuration

2. **Initial Migration Creation**
   - Create baseline migration for existing database schema
   - Include PostgreSQL extensions setup in migrations
   - Test migration on a clean database
   - Success Criteria: Initial migration script created and successfully applied

3. **Migration Workflow Documentation**
   - Document how to create new migrations
   - Document how to apply migrations
   - Document how to roll back migrations if needed
   - Success Criteria: Clear documentation for managing migrations

## Testing Strategy

- Follow the same structure as the application code
- Group tests logically by feature area
- Include both positive and negative test cases

### Testing Standards
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Each feature requires tests before being considered complete
- Tests must be independent and self-contained
- Include edge cases and error handling tests

### CI/CD Integration
- Run tests automatically on code commits
- Ensure all tests pass before deployment
- Generate test reports for review
- Monitor test performance and optimize slow tests
